          <p><strong>Our core beliefs regarding user privacy and data protection</strong><br>
          - User privacy and data protection are human rights.<br>
          - We have a duty of care to the people within our data.<br>
          - Data is a liability, it should only be collected and processed when absolutely necessary.<br>
          - We loathe spam as much as you do!<br>
          - We will never sell, rent or otherwise distribute or make public your personal information.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Relevant legislation</strong><br>
          Along with our business and internal computer systems, this website is designed to comply with the following legislation with regards to data protection and user privacy: <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ:L:2016:119:TOC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EU General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR)</a><br>
          </p>

          <p><strong>Personal information that this website collects and Use</strong><br>
          This website collects and uses personal information for the following reasons:</p>
          
          <p><strong>Site visitation tracking</strong><br>
          Like most websites, this site uses Google Analytics (GA) to track user interaction. We use this data to determine the number of people using our site, to better understand how they find and use our web pages and to see their journey through the website.<br>
          Although GA records data such as your geographical location, device, internet browser and operating system, none of this information personally identifies you to us. GA also records your computer&#8217;s IP address which could be used to personally identify you but Google do not grant us access to this. We consider Google to be a third party data processor.<br>
          GA makes use of cookies, details of which can be found on <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google&#8217;s developer guides</a>.<br>
          Disabling cookies on your internet browser will stop GA from tracking any part of your visit to pages within this website.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Our blog</strong><br>
          Should you choose to add a comment to any posts that we have published on <a href="/blog" target="_blank">our blog</a>, we use Disqus to handle your data. We consider Disqus to be a third party data processor. Disqus privacy policy can be found <a href="https://blog.disqus.com/update-on-privacy-and-gdpr-compliance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.<br>
          NOTE: You should avoid entering personally identifiable information to the actual comment field of any blog post comments that you submit on this website.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Contact forms and email links</strong><br>
          Should you choose to contact us using the contact form on our <a href="/contact/">Contact us page</a> or an email link like <a href="mailto:info@circu.net">this one</a>, none of the data that you supply will be passed to be processed by any of the third party data processors mentioned. The data will be collated into an email and sent to us over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</a>.<br>
          Our own SMTP servers are protected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TLS</a> (sometimes known as SSL). However, not all mail servers are secured in such a way. Therefore, we would suggest that you always consider email as an insecure medium and not include personal, confidential or otherwise sensitive information within an email.<br><br>
          
          Across our web platforms, you will be presented with the opportunity to sign up for newsletters, submit your information to access content such as prices, technical information of our products, and apply for eligibility to certain events and special campaigns. We use the data you provide to us for the following purposes:<br>
          - Provide you with access to the content and campaigns we produce.<br>
          - Analyze profile or behavioral data to help us improve the products we offer to you.<br>
          We will store this information to keep you informed about other relevant products that may be useful to you.<br>
          We will never use or share the information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above.<br><br>

          Some information, such as IP and your email address, may be shared with the following third parties who help us run our website and email programs. They will only use this information to serve our needs and are prohibited from using it in any other instance. They are:<br>
          Salesforce (CRM - customer relationship management software)<br>
          Facebook and Instagram (ad serving)<br>
          Zendesk (chat and help desk).</p>
          
          <p><strong>Email newsletter</strong><br>
          If you choose to join our email newsletter, the email address that you submit to us will be forwarded to <a href="https://www.e-goi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">E-Goi</a> who provide us with email marketing services. We consider E-Goi to be a third party data processor.<br>
          Your email address will remain within E-Goi&#8217;s database for as long as we continue to use E-Goi&#8217;s services for email marketing or until you specifically request removal from the list. You can do this by unsubscribing using the unsubscribe links contained in any email newsletters that we send you or by <a href="mailto:info@circu.net?subject=Website newsletter unsubscribe">requesting removal via email</a>.

          If reasonably necessary or required to meet legal or regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our Terms and Conditions, we may also keep hold of some of your information as required, even after you have closed your account, or it is no longer needed to provide the services to you.<br>
          Where we are permitted to send you direct marketing communications we may retain your contact information necessary for this purpose, (if you have consented to receiving them) for as long as you do not unsubscribe from receiving the same from us.</p>

          <p><strong>Security</strong><br>
          The security of your Personal Information is important to us but, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
